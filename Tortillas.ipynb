    "For the domain understanding part of this project, I used my experience working at Tortillas since the summer of 2022. I've learned a lot about how restaurants work during this time. Also, because Tortillas is in a busy restaurant area, I know a lot about what happens in the neighborhood. I can easily talk to other restaurant workers to learn more. My boss at Tortillas also gave me some good ideas about what might affect how many guests we have, like PSV matches or Effenaar concerts. This helped me figure out what to look for when predicting guest numbers."

After two weeks of waiting, I received only the order deliveries data, which did not include sales data, essential for my intended analysis. Additionally, the order deliveries were aggregated on a weekly basis, making it challenging to make daily predictions accurately. The assumption that all purchases for the week corresponded to sales for that same week was not ideal, as sales could fluctuate daily. Furthermore, due to ethical and privacy concerns, accessing additional data, such as financial records, was not possible.\n",

While this dataset alone may seem insufficient, I recognized the potential to enrich it by incorporating external factors known to influence guest numbers. Factors such as weather conditions, local events, holidays, and special occasions could significantly impact restaurant traffic. With access to this data, I could enhance the complexity of my dataset and improve the accuracy of my predictive model."
